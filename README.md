Market Basket Analysis mainly focusses on data mining technique primarily used to understand the relationships between items purchased together in transactional data. 

The Apriori algorithm identifies frequent itemsets in a transactional dataset and generates association rules from these itemsets. Frequent itemsets are sets of items that appear together in transactions with a frequency above a specified threshold (support).

This Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for performing market basket analysis using a custom implementation of the Apriori algorithm. It calculates and displays frequent itemsets of various lengths that meet a user-specified minimum support threshold. This allows users to explore patterns in transactional data and identify commonly co-occurring items.

By focusing on these areas, Market Basket Analysis helps businesses improve sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and make data-driven decisions about product placement, promotions, and inventory management.
