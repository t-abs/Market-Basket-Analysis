Market Basket Analysis mainly focusses on data mining technique primarily used to understand the relationships between items purchased together in transactional data. 

This Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for performing market basket analysis using a custom implementation of the Apriori algorithm. It calculates and displays frequent itemsets of various lengths that meet a user-specified minimum support threshold. This allows users to explore patterns in transactional data and identify commonly co-occurring items.

By focusing on these areas, Market Basket Analysis helps businesses improve sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and make data-driven decisions about product placement, promotions, and inventory management.
